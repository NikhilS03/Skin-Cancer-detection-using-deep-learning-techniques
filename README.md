# Skin-Cancer-detection-using-deep-learning-techniques
Skin-Cancer is a major life threatening skin disorder, if not diagnosed and treated early this could be fatal. Using deep-learning techniques like CNN, model is trained and the cancer detection could be done.
Dataset is obtained form Kaggel and ISCC
Model achived an accuracy of 87%. Still higher accuracy could be achived by using Data-Normalization tecniques.
